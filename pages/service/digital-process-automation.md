# What is digital process automation?

Digital process automation allows us to use digital technology to execute a process or series of processes to carry out a task or workflow. Information transfer can be automated so everyone on your team can access anything they might need to complete their work.

Think of the things you do every day that keep your business running - you manage your inventory, supply chain and IT, make sales, check in on marketing, complete administrative tasks, and more. Communication often becomes a problem during the completion of these tasks - non-technical people are often confused by poorly designed user interfaces, while others don't have access to the information or files they need. Emails and questions go unanswered, and your competition capitalizes on opportunities you miss due to inefficient processes and outdated systems. By automating your processes, you can stop wondering if you've sent that email, responded to your customer's question or onboarded your newest client - it's all done for you.

## What digital process automation can do for you

Digital automation allows you to digitize and fully automate these processes so you can improve your user or customer experience, gain insight on how to better manage your workflows and make data-driven decisions that yield better ROI for your business.

Here are just a few practical applications for digital process automation:

- Answer customer inquiries via chat bot 
- Respond to service requests instantly 
-  Onboard new customers efficiently and error-free 
- Generate and instantly deliver reports and documents to clients 
- Send emails to a segmented list of subscribers 

Digital process automation helps you streamline customer service, reduce staff workload, manage risk and achieve compliance so you can compete more efficiently and effectively.
