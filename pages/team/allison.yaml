Allison's valuable combination of copywriting, research and journalistic style storytelling skills has proven to be an invaluable asset to Custom Programming Solutions.

As our content developer, she writes web copy, blog posts and other pieces of content on niche technical topics such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Science and more. Her strong research skills and growing knowledge of these highly technical domains mean she can dive much deeper into complex topics and effectively communicate with a variety of audiences from outsiders to domain specialists. She also collaborates closely with technical staff who lack writing skills to write about technical topics for both and non-technical audiences.

Her familiarity with collaboration tools such as GitHub, Version control, markdown, Slack, Zoom and more is also a bonus.
